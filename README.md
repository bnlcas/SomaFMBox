#SomaFM Box

This repo contains code for a dedicated device to stream Music From [SomaFM](http://somafm.com).
This project is not affliated with SomaFM, but gratefully uses their music streaming API.
This repo contains code for a Raspberry Pi to stream music as well as an adruino to monitor a series of dials and switches as the interface.

The device contains the following:
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Arduino Nano
* 2x Rotary Encoders
* 2x Switches
* 1x USB Speaker
* 1x Shoebox
* A bunch of wires and tape

This was just a weekend project, but I felt that it was a lot of fun and wanted to share the code for anyone interested. Will add more materials should interest develop.
